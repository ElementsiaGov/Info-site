                <p><b>The secrets hidden within the palace</b></p>

<p>With the recent passing of Hendroff and Elizabeth, both outstanding role models for Klinton. The royal court of Elementsia found it wise for Paul, the heir of the throne to see a therapist. With advice from her, it was suggested that Paul attends a public school, for a change in things. So, it was done.</p>

<p>During this time a slight decline in his behaviour has been seen. This worried the royal court further, but for the sake of healing, it was chosen for him to stay.</p>

<p>With the passing of a few weeks, things began to settle in, and slowly but surely friends started to pop up. Most known, Peter, a 16-year-old male from Paul's school. It was seen that day in and day out, they were hanging out on a frequent basis.</p>

<p>This led to a quite remarkable search for answers from the royal court, but mostly... from his stepfather, Vertien.</p>

<p>During this time, rumours began to spread regarding Paul's sexuality, since he was just "Different" around Peter. This very much caught the attention of the Elementsian church. Unpronounced to Paul a hidden camera was put up in the hallway leading to his dorm. It showed a video of Paul handling Peter... differently?</p>

<p>This sparked concern from Vertien and The court, although it was handled calmly. The Church however was unpleased and accused Paul of an inability to rule.
They were indeed right. Paul did not want to rule, for he has seen his own father bleeding in his footsteps. But their reasoning was far off than his. They suspected he was... homosexual, a word not to be used often in Elementsia. Especially with the state religion being Christianity.</p>

<p>Still Paul knew about no suspicion, and continued in his ways. One Thursday evening, a dear friend, by the name of Roald knocked and entered his room, surprised to see both the friends... (This is sensitive so I will stop here but you can paint the picture)</p>

<p>In the climactic moment of the moment, as the kingdom teeters on the brink of chaos, Paul makes a heart-wrenching decision that will alter the course of Elementsia's history. It is at this moment that we finally reveal his secret about his sexuality, leaving readers in shock and awe.</p>

<p>This had the Church is outrage, so much so, that they had demanded for him to admit his sins and beg for forgiveness. This however led to more of a rebel in Paul, rendering all forms of assistance uncharted.</p>

<p>The question we all ask:
The Elementsian Church found itself divided, with some members questioning the harsh stance on homosexuality, while others clung fiercely to tradition.
So what will the monarchy do to survive after this event, how will laws be shifted and changed, if it will?</p>
